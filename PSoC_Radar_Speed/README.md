# Speed-measuring system using HB100 radar sensor and PSoC 5LP
The HB100 measures the speed of a moving object using the Doppler effect. This design works for motion whose direction is the same as the axis of the sensor module. The PSoC 5LP amplifies and filters the signal from the radar sensor and measures its frequency.
